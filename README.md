# ExpenseTracker
App to track expenses.

I have been really wanting an app to track my personal expenses. I'm sure there are some great ones out there, but this is something I would like to make for myself to gain more experience with Android development.

Technologies/Patterns I want to use in this app:
1. Material Design

2. MVP

3. Testing

4. Firebase?

5. Picasso/Volley?

6. ButterKnife
